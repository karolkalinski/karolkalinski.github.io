Processing unit ->Lambda

Each processing unit instances holds a partitioned space instance and one or more services that are registered on events on that specific partition.
Together they form an application cluster. If the cluster is required to be highly available, each primary partition has one or more backup partitions, 
which run in their own processing unit instances. These instances are inactive, and become active only when their primary partition fails.
